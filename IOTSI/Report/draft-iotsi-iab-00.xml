<t>This document provides a summary of the IAB Workshop on IoT Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI), which took place at Ericsson offices in Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016.  The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on the different Semantics used by multiple organizations to define IoT information.  This report summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community. The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect the views and positions of the authors, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).</t>

<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture. Some of those workshops required some cooperation effort between organizations. One of the target of the workshops is to bridge those organizations, specially when the topics are out of the scope for the IETF. This long-term planning function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under the leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and area directorates. </t>

<t>There has been significant improvements when it comes to interoperability at lower layers (e.g. IPv4/v6, UDP/TCP, CoAP/HTTP…) but much less progress at higher layers by comparison. Industries and users demand systems that can be acquired and that offer interoperability out of the box in order to assemble them as components of larger systems. </t>

<t>It was left out of the scope of this workshop to impose specific frameworks/solutions to the attendees, transport security and L1/L2/L3/L4 protocol discussion. </t>

</section>
<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>In this document, the key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”,
“SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”,
and “OPTIONAL” are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="common-vocabulary" title="Common Vocabulary">

<t>The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion. There is a need to align between participating organizations on a common set of basic terms. RFC3444 does a start by separating conceptual models for designers or Information Models (IMs) and concrete detailed models for implementors or Data Models (DMs). There are concepts that are undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as how is the interaction with the resources of an endpoint or Interaction Model. There are also terms that suffer the opposite problem and are overloaded with meaning, that meaning will vary depending on the context they are used on (i.e. semantics, models, encoding, serialization format, media types, encoding types…).</t>

<t>“Wished outcome:” During the workshop due to time constrains no terminology was agreed upon, however work will continue within each organization to create various terminology documents. Aggregation will take place at https://github.com/iotsi</t>

</section>
<section anchor="translation" title="Translation">

<t>One of the targets of interoperability is to create translators between the data models. There are analogies with gateways back in 1985 when they were used to translate between network protocols, eventually IP took over providing interoperability, however we lost some of the features provided by those other protocols. The creation of an equivalent “hub/s” that offer translation between the different data models or data semantics seems one of the ways forward. Some lose of expressiveness due to the translation between models seems also unavoidable. </t>

<t>When it comes to translation two different distinctions appear: translating data between data models and translating data models. The first one implies doing the translation at runtime while the second performs one translation between the data models one time, like translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON one. Indeed, for every IM multiple DMs could be translated. </t>

<t>In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is performed. It can be done at “design time” when the information model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model and it can be done depending n the actual serialization. </t>

<t>Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not quite the same. It is easier to translate between systems that follow the same architecture/design pattern than across architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g. stateless vs statefull systems).</t>

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.

   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.

<abstract><t>There has been ongoing confusion about the differences between Information Models and Data Models for defining managed objects in network management.  This document explains the differences between these terms by analyzing how existing network management model specifications (from the IETF and other bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)) fit into the universe of Information Models and Data Models. This memo documents the main results of the 8th workshop of the Network Management Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) hosted by the University of Texas at Austin.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
