 Report from the IAB Workshop on IoT Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)
                           draft-iotsi-iab-00

Abstract

   This document provides a summary of the IAB Workshop on IoT Semantic
   Interoperability (IOTSI), which took place at Ericsson offices in
   Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016.  The main goal of the workshop
   was to foster a discussion on the different Semantics used by
   multiple organizations to define IoT information.  This report
   summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) community.  The views and positions in
   this report are those of the workshop participants and do not
   necessarily reflect the views and positions of the authors, the
   Internet Architecture Board (IAB).

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  Some of those workshops required some cooperation
   effort between organizations.  One of the target of the workshops is
   to bridge those organizations, specially when the topics are out of
   the scope for the IETF.  This long-term planning function of the IAB
   is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by
   working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under
   the leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   area directorates.

   There has been significant improvements when it comes to
   interoperability at lower layers (e.g.  IPv4/v6, UDP/TCP, CoAP/
   HTTP...) but much less progress at higher layers by comparison.
   Industries and users demand systems that can be acquired and that
   offer interoperability out of the box in order to assemble them as
   components of larger systems.

   It was left out of the scope of this workshop to impose specific
   frameworks/solutions to the attendees, transport security and
   L1/L2/L3/L4 protocol discussion.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Common Vocabulary

   The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a
   common vocabulary to start the discussion.  There is a need to align
   between participating organizations on a common set of basic terms.
   RFC3444 does a start by separating conceptual models for designers or
   Information Models (IMs) and concrete detailed models for
   implementors or Data Models (DMs).  There are concepts that are
   undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as how is the interaction
   with the resources of an endpoint or Interaction Model.  There are
   also terms that suffer the opposite problem and are overloaded with
   meaning, that meaning will vary depending on the context they are
   used on (i.e. semantics, models, encoding, serialization format,
   media types, encoding types...).

   "Wished outcome:" During the workshop due to time constrains no
   terminology was agreed upon, however work will continue within each
   organization to create various terminology documents.  Aggregation
   will take place at https://github.com/iotsi

4.  Translation

   One of the targets of interoperability is to create translators
   between the data models.  There are analogies with gateways back in
   1985 when they were used to translate between network protocols,
   eventually IP took over providing interoperability, however we lost
   some of the features provided by those other protocols.  The creation
   of an equivalent "hub/s" that offer translation between the different
   data models or data semantics seems one of the ways forward.  Some
   lose of expressiveness due to the translation between models seems
   also unavoidable.

   When it comes to translation two different distinctions appear:
   translating data between data models and translating data models.
   The first one implies doing the translation at runtime while the
   second performs one translation between the data models one time,
   like translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON one.  Indeed, for every
   IM multiple DMs could be translated.

   In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is
   performed.  It can be done at "design time" when the information

   model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model
   and it can be done depending n the actual serialization.

   Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements
   from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a
   slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for
   example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not
   quite the same.  It is easier to translate between systems that
   follow the same architecture/design pattern than across
   architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g.
   stateless vs statefull systems).
