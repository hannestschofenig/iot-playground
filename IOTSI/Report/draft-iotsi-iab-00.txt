   organizations to define IoT information.  This report summarizes the
   discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF) community.  The views and positions in this report
   are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect
   the views and positions of the authors, the Internet Architecture
   Board (IAB).

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  Some of those workshops required some cooperation
   effort between organizations.  One of the targets of the workshops is
   to bridge those organizations, specially when the topics are out of
   the scope for the IETF.  This long-term planning function of the IAB
   is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by
   working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), under
   the leadership of the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   area directorates.

   In the Internet of Things (IoT) area there has been significant
   improvements on the problem of interoperability in recent years.  The
   transition from IPv4 to IPv6 increases the address space required in
   the IoT context.  At the application layer there seems to be a
   similar consolidation around few protocols that follow either a REST
   (e.g.  CoAP, HTTP) or Publish/Subscribe type of architecture (e.g.
   MQTT).  Above the application layer (i.e. on Data Models and
   Semantics) such degree of interoperability has not yet happened.  The
   work on data formats has not yet reached the same level of
   consistency throughout various standardization groups.

   Thus, the IOTSI Workshop was organized in order to find commonalities
   between the different models proposed by various organizations,
   industries and academia.  Few of the identified topics where:

   o  The different perceived state of the art on data and information
      models.

   o  The lack of an encoding-independent standardization of the
      information, the so-called information model.

   o  The strong relationship with the underlying communication pattern,
      such as an RPC, publish/Subscribe or RESTful designs.

   o  Identifying which similar concepts groups have develop in
      parallel, specially those that would require only slight
      modifications to solve interoperability.

   o  Identifying how existing data models can be mapped against each
      other to offer inter working.

   o  Identifying common use cases for cooperation and harmonization.

   It was left out of the scope of this workshop to impose specific
   frameworks/solutions to the attendees, transport security and
   L1/L2/L3/L4 protocol discussion.

2.  Terminology

   The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a
   common vocabulary to start the discussion.  There is a need to align
   between participating organizations on a common set of basic terms.
   [RFC3444] does a start by separating conceptual models for designers
   or Information Models (IMs) and concrete detailed definitions for
   implementors or Data Models (DMs).  There are concepts that are
   undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as the interaction with the
   resources of an endpoint or Interaction Model.  Therefore the three
   "main" common models that could be identified were:

   Information Model (IM)  it defines an environment at the highest
      level of abstraction, they express the desired functionality.
      They can be defined informally (e.g. in plain English) or more
      formally (e.g.  UML, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc.).
      Implementation details are hidden.

   Data Model (DM)  it defines concrete data representations at a lower
      level of abstraction, including implementation and protocol-
      specific details.  Some examples are: SNMP Management Information
      Base (MIBs), W3C Thing Description (TD) Things, YANG models, LWM2M
      Schemas, OCF Schemas and so on.

   Interaction Model (IN)  it defines how data is accessed and retrieved
      from the endpoints, being therefore tied to the specific

      communication pattern that the system has (e.g.  REST methods,
      Publish/Subscribe operations or RPC-calls).

   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload
   that some terms have.  Meaning will vary depending on the context the
   term is used.  Some examples of such terms are: semantics, models,
   encoding, serialization format, media types or encoding types.  Due
   to time constraints no concrete terminology was agreed upon, however
   work will continue within each organization to create various
   terminology documents, see [IOTSIGIT].

3.  Architecture

   Architectures follow different design patterns, some are REST-
   oriented with clear methods to find and manipulate resources on
   endpoints with almost no state kept between them.  Others are more
   Publish/Subscribe-oriented that focus on the flow of information
   based on the topics of the information that is being shared.  Others
   are RPC-like requiring to know beforehand the set of parameters that
   are accessed, requiring to generate code both on the client and
   server side, they are tightly coupled and service-oriented.

   Thing-hub-cloud  things talk to a hub, which talks back to them and
      to the cloud.  There is a spectrum of emphasis on the hub vs. the
      cloud.  For some the hub is simply an access point; for others it
      is a critical place for control loops and ALGs.

   Meta Thing  some things are actually virtual, like an alarm composed
      of clock, lights, and thermostat.

   Nearby things  some things may be geospatially related even if they
      are not on the same network or within the same administrative
      domain.

   Current data models and definitions for "things" often focus on
   defining actual physical devices and representing their state.  That
   focus should perhaps be shifted into a more holistic or user-oriented
   perspective, defining abstract concepts as well.  On the other a lot
   of focus is placed on human interaction with physical devices while
   IoT will be more oriented to interaction between "things" instead.

   Those things should be designed to be multiple-purpose, keeping in
   mind that solutions should be open-ended to facilitate new usages and
   new future domains of operation. this pattern has already happened,
   devices that were intended for one purpose end up being used for a
   different one given the right context ((e.g. smart phone led light
   turned out to be a heartrate monitor).  IoT domain is currently
   missing insights into what user actually expect.

4.  Translation

   One of the targets of interoperability is to create translators
   between the data models.  There are analogies with gateways back in
   1985 when they were used to translate between network protocols,
   eventually IP took over providing interoperability, however we lost
   some of the features provided by those other protocols.  The creation
   of an equivalent "hub/s" that offer translation between the different
   data models or data semantics seems one of the ways forward.  Some
   lose of expressiveness due to the translation between models seems
   also unavoidable.

   When it comes to translation two different distinctions appear:
   translating data between data models and translating data models.
   The first one implies doing the translation at runtime while the
   second performs one translation between the data models one time,
   like translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON one.  Indeed, for every
   IM multiple DMs could be translated.

   In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is
   performed.  It can be done at "design time" when the information
   model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model
   and it can be done depending n the actual serialization.

   Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements
   from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a
   slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for
   example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not
   quite the same.  It is easier to translate between systems that
   follow the same architecture/design pattern than across
   architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g.
   stateless vs statefull systems).
